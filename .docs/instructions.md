# Optimization task

Right now, there is some code in main.py which attempts to do some string searching. It is written poorly and therefore has a very slow runtime on a large input. Can you rewrite the code in a different file, and make it more optimal both algorithmically and also with respect to data structures so it runs faster?

## Requirements
- final processing of 10 iterations of the search function on shakespeare.txt done within 1 seconds.


## Implementation Steps
read code in app/main.py to understand the current implementation. then, make a new file called optimized.py which contains optimized code. I wrote a test case verifying this in app/test_optimization.py. make sure that test passes.
