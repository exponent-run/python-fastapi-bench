# LLM C Unit Test Writing Challenge

Your task is to write a C unit test for a snake game's state initialization function. This is a test of your ability to:
1. Read and understand existing C code
2. Write a unit test for a specific function
3. Handle memory management correctly in C
4. Create a test that passes compilation and execution

## Instructions

1. First, read and analyze the code in `app/snake/state.h` and `app/snake/state.c`. Focus on understanding the `create_default_state()` function.

2. Next, read the tests defined at app/tests/test.py to learn about the success condition of your task: running python -m pytest app/tests/test.py -v should pass in the end once you have finished your task.

3. Create a new file at `app/llm_test.c` that contains a C unit test for the `create_default_state()` function. Your test file should:
   - Include necessary headers (`state.h`, `assert.h`)
   - Have a `main()` function that runs the test
   - Use the standard C `assert()` macro for validations
   - Properly free any allocated memory

4. Requirements for your test:
   - Write a test function named `void test_create_default_state(void)`
   - Include meaningful assertions that verify the correct initialization of the game state
   - Test both the structure initialization and memory allocation
   - Clean up any allocated memory to avoid leaks
   - Call the test function from main()

5. Your test will be compiled and run using:
```bash
python -m pytest app/tests/test.py -v
```

## Success Criteria

Your submission will be considered successful if:
1. The test function is properly named test_create_default_state
2. The test contains at least one meaningful assertion
3. The code compiles successfully
4. The test passes when run
