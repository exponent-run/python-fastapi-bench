# Optimization task

Right now, there is some code in main.py which attempts to count words in a file. It is written poorly and therefore has a very slow runtime on a large input. Can you rewrite the code in a different file, and make it more optimal both algorithmically and also with respect to data structures so it runs faster?

## Requirements
- Final processing time of shakespeare.txt must be under 3 seconds

## Example output:
Processing time: 0.13 seconds
[('i', 10555), ('you', 6514), ('my', 6031) ... ('he', 3447)]

## Implementation Steps
make a new file called optimized.py which contains optimized code. I wrote a test case verifying this in app/test_optimization.py. make sure that test passes.
